## All Full Stack Development Projects Showcasing My Unique Skills

As a web developer, I need an accessible site that showcases my unique talents working with fullstack development & my wide range of styling formats so potential clients, investors, & employers can understand the value I can bring to their vision. Acute functionality at the backend does not diminish the overall design & aesthetics at the frontend of my projects. I understand the importance of UI to any company's success & make this a priority when crafting a dynamic webpage without losing crucial backend data functioning.  

The 'work' section will continue to grow as my portfolio does. Each new project will receive its own image with imbedded link so that users may browse all applications that are deployed under my unique coding templates. Please note the attention to detail in every project. I strive to go above-and-beyond with each task I am given & approach each one with a set of fresh eyes, allowing every application to have its own style & unique features. 

This porfolio has been a wonderful challenge that has helped me grow as a web developer, allowing me to quickly learn & strengthen my problem-solving, researching, & design skills. It has shown me my weaknesses as well as my strengths & with this new awareness, I will continue to refine my abilities at becoming a well-rounded developer.
